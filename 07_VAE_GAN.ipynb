In an autoencoder, the input image was transformed into a vector which encoded the information from the image in a lower dimensionality space. Then, we decoded that vector to get a reconstruction of the input image. However, the model was focused on encoding existing data for representation learning or similar purposes. To tackle the generation of new data, we will use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) approach. The image shows an overview of the VAE method.\n",

What is the problem here? Using a standard sampling method, i.e by directly sampling using the mean and standard deviation output by the encoder, we cannot train it in an end-to-end manner as sampling is not a differentiable operation.\n",

Now, the sampling process is just a factor multiplying by the prediction $\\sigma_\\phi$ of the encoder, meaning we can propagate the gradients from the output back to the encoder.

        "The evaluation of a generative model quantitatively is a problem that is being research. The metric should evaluate the coverage, i.e. how diverse the generated data is, and sample quality, which is related to the visual quality of the sample. A widely used metric is the Inception Score, which is defined as:\n",

Ideally, what we want is $p(y|x)$ to be \"peaky\" and $p(y)$ to be uniform. $p(y|x)$ is the predicted probability vector $y$ given a generated sample $x$ by a model, in this case an Inception model (hence, the name of the score). If the sample $x$ is of high quality, the model should classify it with confidence in one of the available classes, hence the \"peaky\" $p(y|x)$. The term $p(y)$ is related to the diversity of the data, and is the marginal probability computed as $\\int_z p(y|x=G(z))dz$, hence we average the predicted probabilites of the Inception model for the given samples. If the data is diverse, we will see approximately obtain a flat $p(y)$.\n",
