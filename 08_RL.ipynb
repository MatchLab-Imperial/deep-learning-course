Specifically, let's say you select the action UP, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going UP, 1/3 of going RIGHT and 1/3 of going LEFT.

Softmax policy refers to sampling the next action following the probability distribution given by $Softmax(Q(s, a))$. We provide you the NumPy softmax function to normalize the Q-Values into a probability function to use before sampling.
