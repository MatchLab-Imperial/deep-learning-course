        "# Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a specific type of architecture that is widely used to deal with sequential information. So far, the introduced CNN architectures from the previous tutorials treated inputs as independent objects, however, many applications need to deal with data that is interconnected. For instance, if you are translating a sentence from English to Taiwanese, and you are predicting the next word, it is useful to know which words came before the last one.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs are called recurrent since they apply the same operation to each of the input sequences, with the output of an individual element being dependent on the previous one. Theoretically, RNNs establish a connection between the actual input and ALL the previous ones. Although this is assumed, in the practice, RNNs have proven to only *remember* a limited number of inputs. In other words, RNNs have a *memory* that allows them to *remember* previous elements and use their information to deal with the current input.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs can be split into multiple types depending on their applications. For instance, if we want to predict one word given only the previous one, the topology of our network is a *One to One*. Another example is image captioning, where we can design a *One to Many* architecture to obtain a description from a single input image. The following diagram shows the different types of problems we can face ([Source](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)):\n",

        "\n",
        "Although RNN can assure short-term dependencies within the network, simple RNNs become unable to learn to connect information as the gap between past and present information grows. To overcome this limitation, in practical applications LSTM unit is adopted, that is a special RNNs architecture composed of multiple interacting layers ([Source](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)):\n",

The image depicts a sequence classification problem, where the red blocks are inputs, the green blocks the RNN model, and the blue block is the output.

However, as those numbers are arbitraryly chosen, it would be really hard for the RNN to understand the relationships between the words. To give the model more representation power, we first want to transform the integer to a vector of dimension $d$ which represents the semantic meaning of the words. Each of these vectors is called an Embedding. The actual values of the vectors are not important, only the relationships between them. For example, `dog` and `cat` vectors are probably going to be closer than `dog` and `the`.

        "Now let's start tackling a text classification problem. We first load the IMDB dataset for sentiment classification. As we said, it contains movie reviews with a corresponding binary sentiment label (label=1 corresponds to positive sentiment, and label=0 to negative sentiment). The words are already encoded as integers in order from most common words to less common (e.g. `the` is a common word so it should be encoded as a small integer). That makes it easy to filter the non-common words by using the argument `num_words` when loading the data. The filtered words will be all encoded as a special token `<UNK>`, which means unknown. For example, if we want to load the dataset with only the top $5000$ most common words we can do this:"

In this case we are loading the $5000$ most common words in IMDB, so each word would be encoded in a vector of dimensionality $5000$.

In this dataset the number of words is really large, so if we used a word-level model the number of available classes would be quite large if we did not filter the number of possible words. For this example, instead of encoding on a word level, we will do it on a character level, which results in a more limited vocabulary. We aim to predict the next character when inputting a sentence of length $d$. In evaluation mode, i.e. when we are predicting the next character, we then input a seed of $d$ characters as the first input, and afterwards we use the last $d$ characters as input to predict the next character.\n",

However, word-level models usually present higher performance as it easier for them to keep track of the long-term meaning of the sentence, and also can avoid any spelling mistakes that may happen in character-level models.\n",

However, the character `c` can also be a possibility, as the sentence formed may be `the cat and the doctor`. When deciding what character to predict, a strategy is to just take the character with the maximum probability at all times, but then the variability of the formed text is then smaller. Another option would be to sample following the same probability of distribution as the model outputs. However, this might result in a excessive variability with some sentences not making any sense.\n",

BLEU looks for matches on a word level between the generated text and the reference text. Specifically, BLEU looks for matches in n-grams up to $n=4$, where an n-gram is defined as a contiguous sentence of $n$ items. For example, in the sentence `the sky is blue`, an n-gram of $n=2$ would be `is blue`. BLEU scores range from [0,1].\n",

In our text generation task there is a large number of both grammatically and semantically correct possibilities when generating new sentences, and one of the issues for this task is to develop a metric that can properly evaluate the semantic and syntactic quality of the generated text. Human evaluation is quite common when evaluating the quality of generated sentences in these less constrained tasks due to the difficulty of finding proper automatic metrics. However, we hope to see a correlation between the BLEU score and the quality of the generated text. Here we take an input sentence from the test data and generate a sentence. Then, we compare the generated sentence to the real one from the corpus. We do so 20 times and provide the average BLEU score.\n",

However, during the last 3 years (since the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was published) a new architecture, the Transformer, has started to outperform RNNs in several text/NLP benchmarks. A Transformer does not use any recurrence, it instead uses attention to focus on specific parts of a sentence.
