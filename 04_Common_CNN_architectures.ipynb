One of the most famous problems among the computer vision community was the annual software contest run by the ImageNet project, **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**. This contest evaluates how well an algorithm does in the tasks of object category classification and detection. The challenge provides hundreds of object categories and millions of images. The resolution of those images is also bigger than those on MNIST or CIFAR datasets.\n",

However, as the whole dataset of CIFAR10 resized ot 224x224 would not fit in our RAM, we need to create a preprocessing step before the first layer. That would take the 32x32 images and, just before going into the architecture, resize them into our desired shape. To do so, we use the `Lambda` layer in Keras, which wraps any expression (in this case `resize_images`) in a layer. We can see how this function looks like for a single batch of 32 images."

The second place was close to 26.2%, and it was not a CNN based system. AlexNet shares a lot in common with its predecessor architecture, [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) network by Yann LeCun et al. When LeNet came out, the computational complexity of the networks was an important constraint. Nowadays, with GPUs being every day more and more powerful, the computational complexity is more plausible to deal with that it was years before. Therefore, the authors in AlexNet decided to make the architecture bigger by using more convolutional layers and more filters.\n",

The architecture uses layers with strides, max poolings, dropouts, ReLU activation functions, and three dense layers at the very end. In their original work, the network was split into two streams, as seen in the figure above. That was because GPU constraints, and hence, the authors needed to train it on two separate GPUs. We found a great implementation in [Rizwan's blog](https://engmrk.com/alexnet-implementation-using-keras/), where it presented an AlexNet model without the split concept."

Therefore, we switch the last dense layer in the model to be able to perform classification on CIFAR10. Moreover, a common practise when using pre-trained networks is to freeze the model and only train the new dense layer. This strategy is called Transfer Learning. You can read more about it and its difference to Fine-tuning in this great [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/cnn-transfer-learning-fine-tuning-9f3e7c5806b2).
