One of the most famous problems among the computer vision community was the annual software contest run by the ImageNet project, **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**. This contest evaluates how well an algorithm does in the tasks of object category classification and detection. The challenge provides hundreds of object categories and millions of images. The resolution of those images is also bigger than those on MNIST or CIFAR datasets.\n",

Remember that they were designed for ImageNet, and were trained using 224x224 crops.\n",

However, as the whole dataset of CIFAR10 resized ot 224x224 would not fit in our RAM, we need to create a preprocessing step as we load our data. That would take the 32x32 images and, just before going into the architecture, resize them into our desired shape. To do so, we use the `transform` function in Pytorch, which applies any specified transforms (in this case `resize_images`) in a set. We can see how this function looks like for a single batch of 32 images."

The second place was close to 26.2%, and it was not a CNN based system. AlexNet shares a lot in common with its predecessor architecture, [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) network by Yann LeCun et al. When LeNet came out, the computational complexity of the networks was an important constraint. Nowadays, with GPUs being every day more and more powerful, the computational complexity is more plausible to deal with that it was years before. Therefore, the authors in AlexNet decided to make the architecture bigger by using more convolutional layers and more filters.\n",

        "The network consisted of convolutional layers with kernels of size 11x11, 5x5 and 3x3. The architecture uses layers with strides, max poolings, dropouts, ReLU activation functions, and three dense layers at the very end. In their original work, the network was split into two streams, as seen in the figure above. That was because GPU constraints, and hence, the authors needed to train it on two separate GPUs. We found a great implementation in [Rizwan's blog](https://engmrk.com/alexnet-implementation-using-keras/), where it presented an AlexNet model without the split concept."

VGGNet is similar to previous AlexNet network, however, it only contains 3x3 convolutional kernels and many more filters. It has become really popular since researchers have found that it can be used to extract powerful feature representations from an image. Therefore, extracted features have proven that they are useful for many other computer vision domains and not only image classification. For instance, they can be used in feature representation, style transfer, or image captioning. You can check the [Oxford VGG paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) for further details.\n",

In the original VGG, the last layer is designed to classify among the 1,000 classes provided in ImageNet. In CIFAR10, as we already know, we only have ten classes. Therefore, we switch the last dense layer in the model to be able to perform classification on CIFAR10. Moreover, a common practise when using pre-trained networks is to freeze the model and only train the new dense layer. This strategy is called Transfer Learning. You can read more about it and its difference to Fine-tuning in this great [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/cnn-transfer-learning-fine-tuning-9f3e7c5806b2). Updating only the weights of the last layer provides several advantages; faster training time, good performance, and sometimes helps the networks to not overfit in small datasets."

First of all, if we want to use any other image resolution than 224x224, we need to only use the model `features`. This argument will remove all dense layers at the end of the architecture. Remember that the dense layer comes after a flatten layer (see the model summary above) and, therefore, the size of the flatten vector is fixed. If we modify the input image size, the flatten vector would inevitably change as well. Hence, we need to redefine all dense layers within the model every time we switch the input size."

The UNet architectural idea is similar to a regular encoder-decoder layout but with skip connections. The first part of the network encodes the image and reduces it to a map of smaller size, forcing it to capture more global information. Then, the next part is in charge of decoding the image from that reduced feature map.\n",

        "ConvNeXt is a modern convolutional neural network architecture introduced by Facebook AI Research in the 2022 paper titled \"[A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)\" by Liu et al. It reimagines the classic ResNet architecture by integrating design principles from Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as large kernel sizes, inverted bottlenecks, depthwise convolutions, Layer Normalization, and GELU activations. Despite being fully convolutional, ConvNeXt matches or even surpasses the performance of transformer-based models like the Swin Transformer on benchmarks such as ImageNet. Its success demonstrated that, with the right architectural updates, CNNs can remain competitive in the transformer era, significantly influencing how researchers view the future of convolutional models in computer vision.\n",
