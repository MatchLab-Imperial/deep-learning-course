        "CNNs have revolutionised the field of computer vision in the last decade. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky introduced the AlexNet architecture to win the ImageNet Challenge (one of the most important competitions on image classification within the Computer Vision community), by reducing the top-5 error more than 10 percentage points, which was an incredible improvement at that time. As of now, CNNs are used not only on image classification but in many other computer vision tasks.\n",

The final shape of the image representation is conditioned on the type of problem/task that the architecture is facing. For instance, the output of the last layer in a classification problem is a probability vector. Each dimension of the probability vector represents how likely is that the input image belongs to a specific class. However, the architecture design is up to us, and therefore, we could code a network that outputs a single value for regression problems, or that generates a new image map for semantic segmentation. Now, let's dig in a bit into CNN and introduce some layers that are widely used."

Hence, instead of jumping one pixel apart, we can define the number of skipped elements before computing the weighting sum between the kernel's weights and input features. A stride of 1 means that features will be extracted from all windows a pixel apart, so basically, every single window is computed. A stride of 2 means that we are selecting windows 2 pixels apart, skipping every other window in the process. Strides reduce the number of computations and consequently the size of the output map. In practice, as we go deeper into the CNN, the spatial size of the feature map gets smaller while the number of channels increases. Moreover, we can further reduce the size of the feature map using pooling operations, which we introduce later in this tutorial.\n",

However, when dealing with RGB images or feature maps, the input is no longer a single-channel map but, instead, they can have multiple channels. In the case of an RGB image, for each 2D convolution, we will need to define 3 kernels to interact with each of the image's channel colours. This group of kernels is called a filter. Thus, a filter is a collection of kernels that produces a single output.\n",

Due to the element-wise multiplication, the number of kernels on each filter must be the same that the number of channels in the input feature map. Keras already deals with the number of kernels inside each filter. Keras keeps track of the input size in each convolutional layer unlike other frameworks (Pytorch or TensorFlow). Hence, in Keras, we must only decide the number of filters (output channels) in each layer.\n",

        "It is a common practice to insert a pooling layer between convolutional layers in CNNs. In a standard CNN architecture, we set the feature sizes to become smaller progressively to reduce the computation in the networks, and to merge the information from different spatial locations. To reduce the feature map sizes, we can either use bigger stride size in the convolutional layers or we can use pooling layers. Pooling layers perform a spatial sliding window and apply an operation to reduce the spatial size. Those operations vary depending on the architecture, being the max, mean and min pooling the most typical ones. Here, we will explain the max pooling, although all the others work similarly. Max pooling keeps only the max value in a neighbourhood, where the neighbourhood is defined by the size of the kernel. Let's visualise it, the next example shows the result of a Max Pooling layer with a 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2.\n",

However, contrary to convolutional layers, pooling layers operate independently on each of the input channels, without modifying the depth of the feature maps. To add max pooling to our model we need to import `MaxPooling2d` from `keras.layers` and define the stride and pooling size."
